HOMEWORK:

Create a frontend with Svelte and a backend with Express, like I do in my video, for a model of "Videogames", stored in a file "videogames.json". See my video for file structure!

Your form should have:

- Name
- Platform it's on
- Year of release
- Genre
- ESRB rating
- Boolean value of whether it's good or not.

BONUS:
Add an IMAGE FILE UPLOADER to the Form, and save it in the backend as well! ( ask for help if you need )
