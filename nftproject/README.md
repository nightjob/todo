# Day 19 - NFT Viewer

I've received an assignment from my boss to create an app that can view NFTs across multiple chains. It should have responsive design (work on mobile as well as tablet and desktop views), it should use modern design patterns, and should have a code architecture that is easy to use, follow, and add to.

And should have quality test coverage for this.

Hard Requirements:

1. It should support the following chains initially:

- Ethereum
- IMX
- Solana

2. It should support the following wallets:

- Metamask
- Wallet Connect (mobile)
- GME Wallet
- Coinbase Wallet

3. It should have tests for all the NFT fetching functionality.

4. The NFT functionality should be separate from the components.

5. It should be auto deployed on Vercel via Vite.

6. It is NOT allowed to use any or unknown typings. Everything must have a type, and be type-safe.

7. IT should have responsive deisgn, work well on any device, and look MODERN and GREAT! This is a portfolio piece, really do the CSS part amazingly.
